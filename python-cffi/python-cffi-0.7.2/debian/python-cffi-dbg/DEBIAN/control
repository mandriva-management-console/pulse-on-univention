Description: Foreign Function Interface for Python calling C code (Debug version)
 Convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python.
 .
 The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling
 C code from Python. It keeps Python logic in Python, and minimises the C
 required. It is able to work at either the C API or ABI level, unlike most
 other approaches, that only support the ABI level.
 .
 This package contains the debug version of python-cffi.
